# Work-Day-Calendar

I created a workday calendar to track your hourly goal and progress throughout the weekday. It features an editable color changing sections to indicated current, past, and future hours. The sections range from 9AM to 5PM following the average workday. The page is able to be refreshed and will keep your notes/plans due to the use of local storage. 

The HTML and CSS code was given to me mostly finished though I had to make some of my own changes and I wrote the JS code from scratch. 

The finished site can be found here [Here](https://elliottli97.github.io/Work-Day-Calendar/)
